## Technical Architecture Questions

### 1. What is the technology stack used in your project?

**Answer:** The project uses a modern full-stack technology stack:
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15.2.4 with React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes with MongoDB
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js with JWT
- **Form Handling:** React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI Components:** Radix UI primitives
- **Deployment:** Vercel-ready configuration

### 2. Explain the project structure and why you chose this architecture?

**Answer:** The project follows Next.js 13+ App Router structure:
```
├── app/                    # App Router pages and API routes
│   ├── api/               # Backend API endpoints
│   ├── models/            # MongoDB schemas
│   ├── actions/           # Server actions
│   └── [pages]/           # Frontend pages
├── components/            # Reusable UI components
├── lib/                   # Utility functions and configurations
├── hooks/                 # Custom React hooks
├── types/                 # TypeScript type definitions
└── public/                # Static assets
```

**Benefits:**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear separation between frontend and backend
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript implementation
- **Scalability:** Modular component structure
- **Performance:** Next.js optimizations and server-side rendering

### 3. How does authentication work in your application?

**Answer:** Authentication is implemented using NextAuth.js with the following flow:
- **Login/Signup:** Users can register or login via email/password
- **Session Management:** JWT tokens are used for session management
- **Protected Routes:** Middleware protects routes requiring authentication
- **Role-based Access:** Users have 'user' or 'admin' roles
- **Security:** Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs

**Key Features:**
- Automatic session validation
- Secure token storage
- Role-based authorization
- Middleware protection for private routes

## Database and Data Modeling

### 4. Explain your database schema design.

**Answer:** The application uses MongoDB with two main collections:

**User Schema:**
```typescript
{
  name: string (required)
  email: string (unique, required)
  password: string (hashed, required)
  phone?: string
  role: 'user' | 'admin' (default: 'user')
  profilePhoto?: string
  coverPhoto?: string
  timestamps: true
}
```

**Property Schema:**
```typescript
{
  title: string (required)
  description: string (required)
  price: number (required)
  listingType: 'sell' | 'rent' (required)
  propertyType: 'apartment' | 'villa' | 'house' | 'office' | 'building' | 'townhouse' | 'shop' | 'garage'
  address: {
    street, city, state, zipCode (all required)
  }
  details: {
    sqft, bedrooms, bathrooms (required)
    yearBuilt (optional)
  }
  amenities: string[]
  images: string[]
  contactInfo: { name, phone, email }
  owner: ObjectId (ref: User)
  status: 'active' | 'pending' | 'sold' | 'rented'
  timestamps: true
}
```

### 5. Why did you choose MongoDB over other databases?

**Answer:** MongoDB was chosen for several reasons:
- **Flexibility:** Schema-less design allows easy property data variations
- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling capabilities
- **JSON-like Documents:** Natural fit for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Geospatial Queries:** Built-in support for location-based searches
- **Performance:** Fast read/write operations for property listings
- **Mongoose ODM:** Provides schema validation and middleware

## Frontend Development

### 6. Explain the component architecture and reusability.

**Answer:** The application uses a modular component architecture:

**Core Components:**
- `Navbar`: Navigation with authentication state
- `HeroSection`: Landing page hero with search functionality
- `PropertyListing`: Main property display component
- `PropertyTypes`: Property category filtering
- `ContactAgent`: Contact forms and agent information

**UI Components (shadcn/ui):**
- Form components with validation
- Modal dialogs for property management
- Responsive design components
- Theme support (light/dark mode)

**Benefits:**
- **Reusability:** Components can be used across different pages
- **Maintainability:** Easy to update and modify
- **Consistency:** Unified design system
- **Performance:** Optimized rendering with React 19

### 7. How do you handle form validation and user input?

**Answer:** Form validation is implemented using:
- **React Hook Form:** For form state management
- **Zod:** For schema validation and type safety
- **Real-time Validation:** Instant feedback to users
- **Server-side Validation:** Additional validation on API endpoints

**Example Validation Schema:**
```typescript
const propertySchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1, "Title is required"),
  price: z.number().positive("Price must be positive"),
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email format"),
  // ... other validations
});
```

## Backend and API Development

### 8. Explain your API architecture and endpoints.

**Answer:** The API follows RESTful principles with Next.js API routes:

**Authentication Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/signup` - User registration
- `POST /api/login` - User authentication
- `GET /api/auth` - Session validation

**Property Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/property/add` - Create new property
- `GET /api/property/list` - Fetch property listings
- `PUT /api/property/update` - Update property details
